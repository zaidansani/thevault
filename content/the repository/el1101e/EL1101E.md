> [!info] EL1101E: The Nature of Language
> 
> This introductory overview of linguistics explores the nature of language in terms of its structure and use. Through the analysis of patterns of sound, form, and meaning, at the levels of words, sentences, and texts, students will gain insight into how these different aspects of language fit together, forming an organic, rule-governed system. A key feature of the course is its emphasis on independent inquiry and evidence-based learning. The exploration undertaken in this course should prove useful to students with an active interest in language and its relation to mind, communication, and culture.
