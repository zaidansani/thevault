# Human Language

> [!question] 
> Is it possible to teach animals to use forms of language by using signs/symbols?

Speech is not possible as animals do not necessarily have the same apparatus as human to speak in a way humans do. Animals however can learn to communicate using signs and symbols, but they do not produce ==extended discourse containing a potentially infinite number of novel utterances==. This means that they do not put the signs together in a new way to come up with a new statement.

Languages look very different on the surface as each language is unique and specific, but all languages contain the ==same general elements and follow the same organizational principles== and are ==equally capable== of conveying all the complex meanings that human communicate. This means that ==generally, human language is overall the same==.
