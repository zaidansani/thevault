title: Word Class
---
> [!definition] Word class
>  Also known as parts of speech or lexical categories

> [!definition] Open classes
> Lexical/content words such as noun, verb, adjectives and adverbs.
> 
> These words have relatively concrete (with content) meanings. New words are constantly created and added to these classes.

> [!definition] Closed classes
> Function/grammatical words such as determiner, prepositions, pronouns, conjuctions
> 
> This class does not generate new words generally. Used to express and understand functional/grammatical relationship between lexical words.

Words that belong to the same class share similar properties, such as:
- morphological possibilities
- distribution/function
- similar types of meanings (_not reliable_) - will not be used

> [!note] Morphological possibilities
> Refers to what kinds of morphological operations can apply to the word.
> Generally refers to inflection suffixes.

> [!note] Distribution
> Refers to where the word occurs in a phrase/sentence

> [!note] Function
> Refers to the function of the word

These criterias are **sufficient**, not necessary.

> [!note] Sufficiency criteria
> Not all the possibilities need to be available in the word for it to qualify for the word class
> 
> Mathematically, $A \implies B$, but not necessarily $A \not \Leftarrow B$.

# Identifying a word class
In general, the more evidence found, the better. Since the criterias are sufficiency, instead of necessary, all criterions should be covered. 

A good way of "diagnosing" a word class would be to consider a word class a "disease", and a property, a symptom. This means that the more symptoms, the more backing there is for that said diagnosis.
# Nouns
**Morphological possibilities**
- can be pluralised
- can take possessive marker

**Distributional possibilities**
- can appear as `A` or `B` in the phrase `a A of B`
- can be preceded by determiners and adjectives in a noun phrase
# Verbs
**Morphological possibilities**
- can be marked for tense
- can exhibit agreement with subject
	- @ the morphological shape of verbs in the present tense depends on whether the subject is singular, etc

**Distributional possibilities**
- typically appears after subject
- can be negated with do not/don't
- can appear after auxiliary verbs
	- ~ has, have, had, might, must ......

# Adjectives
**Morphological possibilities**
- can be inflected to form comparative or superlative
	- @ -iest, -ier (earliest, earlier)

**Distributional possiblities**
- can occur between a determiner and a noun
- can follow copula/linking verb `be`
	- ~ am, are, was, being, be....
- can follow more/most (idea of comparative/superlative)
- can co-occur with other adjectives

**Function**
- to modify nouns
# Adverbs
(traditional ragbag category for content words) - if a content word is not a Noun, Verb, or Adjective, it is generally an Adverb.

**Morphological possibilities**
- comparative and superlative forms (like adjectives)

**Distributional possibilities**
- freedom of positioning
- can follow more/most (idea of comparative/superlative, like adjectives)

**Function**
- to modify things other than nouns, like the sentence, or verbs

# Determiner
> [!definition] Noun phrase
> String of words that can be replaced by pronouns

**Distributional possibilities**
- precedes a noun (and optionally adjectives) in a noun phrase

Multiple types:
- possessive `her, his`
- quantificational `every, some`
- demonstrative `this, those`
# Pronouns
**Morphological possibilities**
- ! Does not apply

**Distributional possibilities**
- Does not precede nouns in a NP (and replace them instead)
# Preposition
**Morphological possibilities**
- ! Does not apply

**Distributional possibilities**
- precedes a pronoun or an NP (since a NP and pronouns are interchangeable)

> [!important] Difference between determiner and preposition
> The determiners form an NP with the following noun, but prepositions don't.
