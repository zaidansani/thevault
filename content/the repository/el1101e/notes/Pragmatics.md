# Implicature

> [!definition] Conversation implicature
> One way of understanding what is not said - generally what is implied by the utterance (but not uttered)

> Even if A is true, B might not be true.

Implicatures can be intended or accidental.

> [!note] Cooperative principle
> The assumption that our interlocutors (the people we talk to) are being cooperative, and follow certain conversational conventions.

When maxims are violated, speakers do not follow conventions, and when interlocutors are not being cooperative, it generates implicatures.

> [!important] Implicatures are the result of the hearer's inference. 

Speakers can try to generate implicatures by intentionally violating one of the Gricean maxims.

Unintentional violations can occur when hearers arrive at implicatures not intended by the speaker when speaker can violate maxims unintentionally or doesn't follow the same conventions as the hearer.

> [!definition] Speech act theory

Illocutionary types:
- illocutions can be categorised into several broad types
	- representative - describe some state of affairs
	- directive - get the hearer to do something
	- question - get hearer to provide some information
	- commissive - commit speaker to something
	- declaration - change status of some entity, bringing about some state of affairs

> [!definition] Felicity conditions
> Validity of the speech act depends on whether it is performed in the appropriate context, by the appropriate participants.

> [!definition] Explicit speech acts
> Utterance contains a verb that is used performatively.
> 
> Makes explicit the illocution.

To identify performative verbs:
- verb must describe voluntary act
- act can be performed simply with words
- can be used with hereby

> [!definition] Direct speech acts
> Whether illocution is expressed by its matching/default locutionary type


| Illocutionary Type | Matching Locutionary Type |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Directive          | Imperative                |
| Question           | Interrogative             |
| Representative     | Declarative               |
| Commissive         | Declarative               |
| Declaration        | Declarative               |
Locutionary types:
- declarative
	- subject before a tensed/tenseable verb
	- if verb tense can be changed, it is tenseable
- imperative
	- does not contain a tensed/tenseable verb
	- subject is always understood to be you
- interrogative
	- yes/no questions
	- content questions

With indirect speech acts, (where the expected locutionary type is different), it generally expresses something extra.
