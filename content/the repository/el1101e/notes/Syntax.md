> [!definition] Argument
> Expression **required** by an argument-taking expression

For a sentence to be well-formed/grammatical, all the argument-taking expressions it contains must be provided with all the arguments they need.

> [!note] Can be interpreted as arguments for a function (sentence).

For example, an argument-taking expression can be a verb - which usually denote events/relations, which denote participants.

> [!example] **The girl** kicked **the blue ball**
> In this example, **the girl** and **the blue ball** are the arguments.

> [!definition] Subject
> An argument that is described by the argument-taking expression

> [!definition] Complement
> The non-subject argument.

> [!definition] Adjuncts
> 
> Optional expressions - where presence is not required for the acceptability of the sentence

> [!definition] Constituent
> String of elements that belong together

To test for constituency:
1. Answers to questions test
	- ask acceptable question where string of words in question might potentially be answer - question can be from the remainder of words in the sentence
2. Cleft test
	- `It is/was X that Y`
		- if a string of words can go into the `X` position, it forms a constitutent.
3. Topicalisation test
	- If a string of words can appear as the topic of a sentence, it forms a constituent
4. Coordination test
	- `X and/or Y`'
	- if a string of words can be coordinated with another string from the same lexical or phrasal category, it forms a constituent
5. Replacement test
	- May be substituted by a shorter unit
		- `pronoun -> NP` `slept/do so/did so -> VP`

> [!important] Tests for constituency may give rise to inconsistent results for independent reasons.

Proving constituency does not indicate that a certain word is a subject/argument.

> [!definition] Syntactic/phrasal categories
> If a string of words form a phrasal category, they must be constituent

Categories:
- noun phrase (NP)
	- phrasal constituent that can be replaced by pronouns
- verb phrase (VP)
	- phrasal constituent that yields a sentence when combined with an NP on the left
	- can be replaced with
		- slept (changes meaning)
		- does so
- preposition phrases (PP)
	- phrasal constituent made up of P NP sequence
	- can modify a VP within a VP and can modify a N within an NP

Verbs:
- ditransitive verbs
	- require two complements to form a VP
- sentential complement verbs
	- requires a sentential complement to form a VP

> [!definition] Phrase structure rules
> Grammatical rules that describe how phrases are formed in a language

- `S -> NP VP`

Verb phrases
- `VP -> SV S`
- `VP -> IV`
- `VP -> TV NP`
- `VP -> DTV NP NP`
- `VP -> VP Adv
- `VP -> VP PP`

Noun phrases
- `NP -> Pr`
- `NP -> (D) (Adj*) N (PP)`

- `PP -> P NP`

- `X -> X Conj X`

PS tree representations help to visualise
- constituency relations
	- constituents can contain smaller constituents

> [!definition] Structural ambiguity
> Ambiguity that arises when more than one possible structure can be assigned to a word/phrase

PP attachment is a common source of structural ambiguity as they can be in both VP and NP phrases.

> [!definition] Lexical ambiguity
> Ambiguity arises from a word having more than one possible meaning
