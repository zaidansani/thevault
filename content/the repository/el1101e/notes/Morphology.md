# Morpheme

> [!definition] Morpheme
> **A minimal unit of meaning**
> 
> A string containing one or more sounds that can be associated with minimal units of meaning.
> > [!important] Does not need to be a word on its own.
> > > [!example]
> > >  un = "to reverse an action" - morpheme, but not a word.

Morphemes are **identified on the basis of meaning** - morphemes that mean the same in different words are considered instantiations of the same morpheme.

At the same time, the same phrase might be different morphemes in different words.

> [!example] 
> `un` in undo, untied: reverse action (attaches to verbs)
> `un` in unfair, unsafe: not (attaches to adjectives)

> [!definition] Allomorphs
> Slightly different forms of a morpheme (based on pronunciation, not spelling)
> 
> Allomorphs of the same morpheme must mean the same meaning.
> 
> > [!example] The indefinite article
> > `a`, `an` are allomorphs - 
> > both are indefinite articles: non-specific things
> 
> > [!example] Past tense
> > `t`, `d`, `ed` are allomorphs -
> > both indicate an event took place in the past

Allomorphs tend to be phonetically similar.
Similar to allophones, allomorphs in complementary distribution with one another. 

> [!remark] 
> There is no particular convention (whether to use the IPA notation, or the spelling) as morphemes specify meaning instead of pronounciation.

# Inflection and Derivation

> [!definition] Inflectional morphemes
> Does not change the core meaning and word class of a word
> An obligatory affix for a certain grammatical context
> 
> > [!example]
> > `white` & `whiter` - the `r` does not change the core meaning and word class (adjective)
> > 
> > > [!note] 
> > > While there still is a change in the meaning - the **core** meaning of the word does not change.

There are only 7/8 inflectional affixes:
- `s`: 3rd person singular present tense agreement
	- ~ walks
- `ing`: progressive
	- ~ (is) walking
- `en`, `ed`: past participle
	- ~ (has) eaten, (has) walked
- `ed`: past tense
	- ~ walked
- `s`: plural
	- ~ cats
- `er`: comparative
	- ~ taller
- `est` superlative
	- ~ tallest
- `'s`: possesive (debated)
	- ~ John's

> [!definition] Derivational morphemes
> Changes the core meaning and/or word class of a word.
> Creates a new word with a different meaning
> 
> > [!example] Class maintaining but meaning change
> > `do`, `undo` - class maintaining (verb -> verb), but meaning has changed
> 
> > [!example] Class changing & meaning change
> > `white`, `whiten` - class changing (adjective -> verb), and meaning has changed

# Hierarchical Structure
> [!definition] Monomorphemic
> Word that contains only one morpheme.
> 
> (Also called a simple word)

> [!definition] Polymorphemic
> Word that contains more than one morpheme
> 
> (Also called a complex word)

When words contain more than one morpheme, there exists a word-internal structure. Morphemes are then added incrementally to form complex words.

> [!example] `piglets`
> `pig` -> `piglet` -> `piglets`
>
>![[media/hierarchical order.svg]]

> [!important] Derivation occurs closer to the root than inflection.
> 
> > [!example] disappeared
> > `dis-` is derivational, `-ed` is inflectional
> > `disappear` must be formed, before `disappeared.`
> 
> This is as derivation changes the meaning of the inflected word - `dis`-appeared with `dis` meaning not is different to disappeared.

> [!definition] Root
> Morpheme where word formation begins
> 
> The most atomic form of the stem/base.

> [!definition] Stem/base
> Part of a word that a morpheme attaches to
# Free and Bound

> [!definition] Free
> Morphemes that can occur on their own

> [!definition] Affixes
> Morphemes that cannot occur on their own - they are bound morphemes that attach to stems.
> 
> - Prefixes occur before the stem
> - Suffixes occur after the stem
> - Infixes occur inside the stem
> - Circumfixes occur around the stem

> [!remark] Ignore bound roots
> For the purpose of this mod, the scope will only be complex words with relatively transparent morphemic structure - (morphemes that are Latinate roots for example)

# Structural Ambiguity
Word formation is an incremental procedure, and reflects its formation history.

> [!important] Every step must produce a well-formed word.

> [!definition] Structurally ambiguous
> A word that has more than one possible structure and meaning. Each meaning is associated with a different internal structure.

For a word to be structurally ambiguous, it first has to be ambiguous (more than one meaning). 

> [!example] disappearance
> `disappearance` only has one meaning, so even though it can have two possible internal structures
> - `appear` > `disappear` > `disappearance`
> - `appear` > `appearance` > `disappearance`
> the meaning only applies to the first possible internal structure.

> [!example] unlockable
> `unlockable` has two meanings, with two different internal structures.
> 
> `lock` > `unlock` > `unlockable` (able to be unlocked)
> `lock` > `lockable` > `unlockable` (not able to be locked)

# Word Formation
## Affixation

> [!definition] Affixation
> Adding morphemes before (prefix), after (suffix), inside (infix), and around (circumfix)

## Clipping

> [!definition] Clipping
> Removing part of a word
> 
> > [!example] bro
> > brother > bro

> [!definition] Back-formation
> Removing what looks like (but wasn't) an affix
> 
> > [!example] edit
> > editor < edit

## Compound

> [!definition] Compound
> Putting together two or more free stems

## Borrowing

> [!definition] Borrowing
> Words that are borrowed from another language

Generally, the meaning or pronunciation is adapted in the borrowing language.

> [!example] Anime
> The word animation was borrowed into Japanese `anime` - which was reborrowed back to specifically mean Japanese animation

## Eponyms

> [!definition] Eponyms
> Words formed from people or trade names
> > [!example] `erotic`
> > Eros > erotic
## Conversion

> [!definition] Conversion
> Changing word class without adding/removing anything
> > [!example] google
> > Google > google (verb)

## Initialism

> [!definition] Initialism
> Initials pronounced as letters
> 
> > [!example] MRT, KFC, NUS
## Acronyms

> [!definition] Acronyms
> Initials pronounced as a word.
> 
> > [!example] LOL, LMAO
