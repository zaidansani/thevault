# experiences, and work stuff

as part of my diploma requirements, as well as my scholarship at the agency for science, technology and research (a*star), i did an internship at the [institute for infocomm research](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/i2r), where i helped with a machine-learning malware classification system, helping with both data analytics, as well as cybersecurity portions of the project.

i come from a cybersecurity background - i did a diploma in cybersecurity at [ngee ann polytechnic's school of infocomm technology](https://www.np.edu.sg/schools-courses/academic-schools/school-of-infocomm-technology), where i graduated with a diploma with merit, and as valedictorian of my cohort!

# hobbies

i write music sometimes, but it's usually very rudimentary, but it acts as some form of creative outlet for me, which is  a good thing for sure. my music taste is a hodgepodge of mainstream music, coupled with indie music, and it changes from season to season.

i like games (sometimes) - mostly more as an excuse for a cool social activity, but honestly, at this point, i'm more of a football manager guy.

i'm an avid esports FPS fan - specifically a big fan of dev1ce (from cs) as well as the paper rex valorant squad. in addition, i'm a fan of manchester united (unfortunately). football's really fun to analyse - both with the eye, as well as through data - and i can't pretend one of my desired jobs in life isn't being a football data analyst.

and if it wasn't obvious, i'm a tech nerd - and some of that goes to consumer tech (powerbanks, for some reason), and i like keeping up with tech as well.
